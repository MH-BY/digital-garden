# $I^-$ Activation energy and  ion migration

In $MAPbI_3$ several modeling studies and experimental studies have been conducted. The results is varying for the activation energy.
Formation energy: 0.1 - 0.2 eV
Migration : 0.1-0.6 eV for halide ($I^-$) vacancies.

The different migration path of I-.
The activation energy depends on how much lattice distortion is required during movement of the defect.

For experimental result, the value diverse. The reason:
- *Small temperature range*. The Arrhenius relation not clear.
- Device response can be influence by: starting position and source of the defects, diffusion and drift contribution, additional temperature formation, etc
- Measured systems commonly nanocrystalline, not a single crystal. There are ground boundaries.

Big problem:
the device to device variation was too large. The value would be depend on the exact experiment procedure.

(then what about using automation??? may be the sollution)
