# How to organize your book review in Obsidian
#obsidian #tutorial #productivity 

- Create template. Use it every time you encounter books to read. I use mine [[Template/5_Book review template\|5_Book review template]]
- Fill up the metadata. This is important to make database/table. All my book review tagged with type: bookreview. 
```
	type: bookreview
	title: 
	author: 
	genre: nonfiction
	datefinished: 2022
	rating: 4
	notestatus: in progess
	url:
	tags: book, inspiration
```
- Create page to organize books you are working
	- Install plugin called [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview). See [what can dataview do](https://denisetodd.medium.com/obsidian-dataview-for-beginners-a-checklist-to-help-fix-your-dataview-queries-11acc57f1e48)
	- Make new note to make your home for book review. Mine are [[004_PJ_home_BookReview\|004_PJ_home_BookReview]]
	- Use the pluggin by typing this:

	
	it will show this:

- You can modify your query in the dataview to for example: only show book in progress, books with certain tags, short it, etc.
