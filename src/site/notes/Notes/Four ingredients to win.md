# Four ingredients to win

## 1. Roadmap
It is our compass. Our guiding forces behind our every actions. 
It is consists of fundamental elements such as motivation, believe, conviction toward the goal. 
In case of financial roadmap in the book [[Books/Books review/The Millionaire Fastlane (review)\|The Millionaire Fastlane (review)]], there are three roadmaps that will chart your course to wealth ([[Notes/Three roadmap to wealth\|Three roadmap to wealth]])

## 2. Vehicle
Your ultimate vehicle is you. No one can drive the journey but you. It is a complicated system that need frequent tuning and maintenance to ensure optimum performance for your trip.

## 3. Roads
The roads is the pathway you take. In wealth, it can be a job (engineer, project manager, doctor, etc). It can be entrepreneurial road (inventor, investor, retail owner, internet marketer, etc). Just like real world roads, the option are vast. 

## 4. Speed
Speed is execution and our ability to go from idea to realization. We can sit in a Lamborghini but fail to move if we don't hit the accelerator. You can have your road map and roads but never arrive to finish if you have no speed.
