# ConvertKit

Hi, I use the service from [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com/) to manage my [[Notes/Newsletter\|Newsletter]].

### Why?
1. It is because currently Obsidian does not have a feature to see the traffic to [[000_My Second Brain\|000_My Second Brain]].
2. My Obsidian vault is kind a messy. Let me cultivate ideas from my notes, make it edible for you and share it via my newsletter.  

I just want to connect and share it with you guys. I will be happy if some of the ideas in my notes can make a way to connect with yours.

### How?
I documented the [[Notes/How to embed Newsletter on Obsidian\|How to embed Newsletter on Obsidian]].
Check it if you want to know.
