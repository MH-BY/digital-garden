# Productivity advices from the CEOs

Everyone has the same 24 hours in a day. So be us, Elon Musk CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, Jeff Bezos CEO of Amazon, Bill Gates CEO of Microsoft, Jack Dorsey CEO of Twitter and Square. But why the level of productivity seems so different between them and the rest of the population including me? Let's learn some tips from them. 

## Sharpen our focus
Several successful people have common way to sharpen their focus. People such Dorsey, billionaire like Ray Dalio, to Bill gates, doing it by meditation. They make meditation to be their daily routine. Bill Gates stated in his [Gates Notes blog](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Headspace-Guide-to-Meditation-and-Mindfulness?WT.mc_id=12_03_2018_10_EOYBooks2018Headspace_BG-media_&amp;amp;amp;amp;WT.tsrc=BGmedia) that meditation is his favorite productivity habits. "it's a great tool for improving my focus, " he said. He and his wife doing it 2 or 3 times a week, for about 10 minutes each time. 

Meditation help sharpen his focus by teaching him how to pay attention to his thought. “Meditation is simply exercise for the mind, similar to the way we exercise our muscles when we play sports,” he said.

For anyone who'd like to get started with meditation, Gates suggests the book “The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness” by former Buddhist monk Andy Puddicombe.

## Eliminate noise

Steve Jobs excessively eliminating options that are not the best option.
He believe that the key for productivity is knowing when to say 'No'. “Focus means saying ‘no’ to the hundred other good ideas, so you have decide what it makes sense to spend time and energy on, and what doesn’t," Jobs said during the company’s 1997 Worldwide Developers Conference.

Billionaire Warren Buffett also have the same mind set. [Once he said](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/3-things-two-men-learned-from-their-650000-lunch-with-warren-buffett.html) that “the difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say ‘no’ to almost everything.”

In their day to day work, Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey has another tips. 
Have you ever been in marathon meetings with your college? If you are a professional I bet you have experienced that especially during this pandemic where jumping from one online meeting to another is the new normal. 

65% of senior managers says that meetings keep them from completing their work, according to survey from [Harvard Business School and Boston University](https://hbr.org/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness). 71% of 182 managers surveyed believed that meetings are unproductive and inefficient.

Elon and Dorsey eliminates excessive meetings and make it more focus-friendly way.
For Elon, “Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time,” he shared in a letter to his employees in 2018. “Get rid frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter.” he advised. 

For Dorsey, he tried to make meetings more focus friendly by doing what our brain good at: reading and being focus.  
“Most of my meetings are now Google doc-based, starting with 10-minutes of reading and commenting directly in the doc,” [Dorsey tweeted in 2018](https://twitter.com/jack/status/987163806781472768). “This practice makes time for everyone to get on same page, allows us to work from many locations, and gets to truth/critical thinking faster.”

## High velocity decision
According to Jeff Bezos in [his speech back in 2016](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2016-letter-to-shareholders), it is important to make high-quality high-velocity decisions.
Making the right decision sometimes less important than making high-velocity decision. You only need to be good at correcting the incorrect course, quickly. When you are capable of doing that, being wrong may be less costly than you think. While going slowly is expensive for sure.
He also stated that high velocity decision making environment is more fun.

## Conclusion
For now let's try to apply those three tips from the CEOs. 
There are plenty of tips out there as well. Let's add!
