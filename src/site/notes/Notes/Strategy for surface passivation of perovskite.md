# Strategy for surface passivation of perovskite

Surface engineering is the key to improving the device efficiency in perovskite solar cells. 

Organic ammonium halides, the 2D one, are used for passivating the 3D perovskite, resulting in the effective reduction of surface defect density and the increase of Voc and FF. It also provides hydrophobic nature to the perovskite surface and effectively inhibits ion migration.
