# Three roadmap to wealth
In book [[Books/Books review/The Millionaire Fastlane (review)\|The Millionaire Fastlane (review)]] there are three road maps to wealth:
## 1. The Sidewalk
The sidewalkers have no financial destination. 
The plan is to have no plan. They immediately spent their surplus money on the next gadget, new car, fashion. Immediate pleasures. Instant gratification. 
Yet it is the road most traveled because its has the least resistance compares to other roadmaps. 
It never going to works for the long term. The future becomes a mortgage for a peasant present. Thus, it naturally drive you to poorness, both time and money,  [[Books/Books review/The Millionaire Fastlane (review)\|The Millionaire Fastlane (review)]] said.

The wealth is defined by income and debt. 
The wealth equation:
$$
Wealth = Income + Debt
$$

## 2. The Slowlane
The slowlaner sacrifice their today in the hopes of a brighter and freer tomorrow. 

The wealth equation:
$$Wealth = (Primary Income source: Job)+(Wealth accelerator: Market Investment)
$$
$$Wealth = Intrinsic Value + Compound Interest$$
while 
$$
IntrinsicValue = Hourly Wage\times Hours Worked
$$
The plan takes decades to succeed. In corporate world, it often requires masterful political prowess. 
The Saturday and Sunday is the paycheck for their Monday to Friday. So it is $5-2$ . The working hours are fixed five days a week. 
Life isn't great, but it isn't so bad either.

### Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL)
Your wealth tight to *HourlyWage* which is $HourlyRate\times HoursWorked$
which is in unit TIME. 
And also the *CompoundInterest* = $InvestedSum\times (1+Yield)time$
Which is also in unit TIME.

It is tight to your TIME which is limited to only 24 hours a day. And the average lifespan are only 74 years (for salary workers). TIME is our primordial fuel, it shouldn't be traded for money.   

## 3. The Fastlane
The fastlane is a business and lifestyle strategy characterized by **Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL)**
There are four segments: 
1) Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL) Whereas the Slowlane is defined by uncontrollable variables with no leverage, the Fastlane exploits the opposite conditions: maximum control and leverage. 
2) Business Your own business, self-employment, and entrepreneurship are centrist to the Fastlane, much like a job is to the Slowlane. 
3) Lifestyle The Fastlane is a lifestyle choice: a commitment of blended beliefs, processes, and actions. 
4) Rapid Wealth Creation The Fastlane is about creating large sums of wealth rapidly and beyond the confines of “middle class.” 

While in the Slowlane you are the source of heavy lifting, in Fastlane you construct a system that does it for you.

The wealth equation of Fastlane:
$$
Wealth= NetProfit+AssetValue
$$
while, 
$$
NetProfit=(UnitSold)\times(UnitProfit)
$$
and, 
$$
AssetValue = (NetProfit)\times(IndustryMultiplier)
$$
If you want to make more profit:
1. Raise $UnitSold$ by increasing Conversion ratio 
2. Raise $UnitSold$ by for example increasing Web Traffic
3. Raise $UnitProfit$
4.
