# Obsidian Syncthing

I use Syncthing to sync between mac and android. 
Not so convenient, but serve the purpose. 
 
### How to do it?
If you are on Windows, you can follow the steps written here:
https://beingpax.medium.com/how-to-sync-obsidian-notes-across-different-devices-for-free-326423218597
Link to donwload:  https://syncthing.net/downloads/

### But since I am on mac....
I used the article above as a reference.
And the rest, just follow your instinct ðŸ˜†

I will write it down here when I have time.
