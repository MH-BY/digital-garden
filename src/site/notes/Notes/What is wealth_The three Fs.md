# What is wealth? The three F's
>" Wealth is the ability to fully experience life"
> - Henry David Thoreau

According to MJ in his book [[Books/Books review/The Millionaire Fastlane (review)\|The Millionaire Fastlane (review)]], wealth is not authored by material possessions, money, or stuff but by the three fundamental F's:

### 1. Family (relationship)
Wealth is having a strong-spirited familial relationship with people. Not just family, but can be community, God, and friends.
A 2003 World Value Survey (worldvaluessurvey.com) found that the happiest people in the world have a tight senses of community and strong family.

### 2. Fitness (health)
Wealth is healthy, vibrancy, passion, and boundless energy.

### 3. Freedom (choice)
Wealth is having freedom of choice: Freedom to live how you want to live, what kind, when, and where. Freedom from bosses, alarm clocks, and the pressure of money it self. Freedom to pursue dreams, rise our children. Freedom from the drudgery of doing something you hate.
