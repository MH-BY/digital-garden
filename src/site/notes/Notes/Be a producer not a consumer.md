# Be a producer not a consumer
The winning team is Team Producer. Reshape your focus to be producing, not consuming. You have to switch teams from the team of the majority (the consumer ) to the team of the minority (the producer). Become a producer first and a consumer second.
Instead of buying products on TV, sell products. Instead of digging for gold, sell shovels. Instead of taking a class, offer a class. Instead of borrowing money, lend it. Instead of taking a job, hire for jobs. Instead of taking a mortgage, hold a mortgage. Break free from consumption, switch sides, and reorient to the world as a producer.
To consume richly, produce richly first.
