# Be a producer not consumer
The winning team is Team Producer. Reshape your focus to be a producing, not consuming. You have to switch team from the team of majority (the consumer ) to the team of minority (producer). Become a producer first and a consumer second.
Instead of buying products on TV, sell products. Instead of digging for gold, sell shovels. Instead of taking a class, offer a class. Instead of borrowing money, lend it. Instead of taking a job, hire for jobs. Instead of taking a mortgage, hold a mortgage. Break free from consumption, switch sides, and reorient to the world as producer.
To consume richly, produce richly first.
