# About Obsidian
>"A second brain, for you, forever.
Obsidian is a powerful and extensible knowledge base  
that works on top of your local folder of plain text files."

That is their tagline.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful and popular note-taking app that has been gaining traction in the digital world. It's a great tool for writers, students, and professionals alike, as it allows users to quickly capture thoughts, organize notes into meaningful connections, and quickly access the information stored in their notes.

I immediately fall in love with the tools the first time I used them. I found it via a Youtube video during covid-19 quarantine period. After I dig around and found reasons [[Notes/Why I choose Obsidian\|Why I choose Obsidian]], I moved all my notes from Notion to obsidian.

Obsidian uses a graph-based system to organize notes and links. This means that notes can be linked together to form an interconnected network of ideas. The connections between notes can then be explored to uncover new insights or answers to questions. This makes it possible to create an interconnected web of knowledge that can be used for research or simply for exploring ideas. It is like our second brain, helping us to organize ideas and find new serendipity inside it.

The app also allows users to add images, code snippets, previews of documents and other rich media within their notes. This makes it easier to keep track of complex projects or ideas without having to search through multiple documents or applications. 

Obsidian also offers various plug-ins created by the Obsidian team as well by the community. Pretty much any functionality is available to serve your purpose in note taking. At least this is what I feel right now. 

Overall Obsidian is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a powerful note taking app that is easy to use and allows users to quickly capture and access information in an organized way.
