# How to use a glovebox (weighing)

## Preparation
1.  Put on your lab coat, gloves, shoe covers, and head cover before entering the clean room.
2. Make sure that the glove box is in default "initial condition": the gloves on glove-box are blown onward. It indicates that the pressure is quite high inside the glove box. We do it to prevent any oxygen from entering the glovebox during the idle condition.

## Start using the glovebox
1. Lower the pressure 
	1. In the control panel, press the big box in the middle containing Press, H2O, O2. It opens a new window to set the parameters.
		1. Upper working limit: How high the pressure can go before the valve opens and the glovebox lets go of the excess pressure. The default idle condition is 6.0 mbar
		2. Lower working limit: How low the pressure can go before the valve opens and the gas goes inside. The default idle condition is 4.0 mbar
	2. Lower the "Lower working limit" to 1.0. Press the "Lower working limit">press "1">press Enter sign.
	3. Press "BACK". It's like an enter button.
	4. Press "End"
	5. Step on the left pedal to lower the pressure.
2. Prepare anything we want to bring into the glove box. Droppers, syringes, needles, spatula, containers, etc. Bring also gloves to be worn inside the glovebox so that the black glove does not get dirty (XL size, take from outside the CR).
3. Open the chamber for transferring stuff.
	1. Rotate the black valve under the chamber clockwise direction to let the gas (outside atmosphere) come in.
	2. Rotate counterclockwise the black knob on the chamber's blue cover. Do not rotate it too far
	3. Rotate the blue cover counterclockwise
	4. Open the blue cover carefully.
4. Put your stuff inside the chamber
5. Close the cover
	1. Turn the blue cover clockwise.
	2. Turn the black knob clockwise to tighten.
	3. Turn the valve below the chamber counterclockwise direction to draw the vacuum.
	4. Do vacuum->evacuate, 3 times.
	5. Leave it at least 10-15 minutes in total before transferring inside the vacuum chamber.
	6. Make sure to add pressure in the glovebox if the black gloves go limp.
6. Fill up the form for the initial condition: time, name, what we want to do, Oxigen (ppm), argon gas (the one without red paint)
7. Purging
	1. We want to keep the Oxigen below 20-10 ppm
	2. The default is in circulation mode. The pump draws the gases to filter the Oxigen, and put it back to the glovebox.
	3. To lower the Oxigen, press the "Function">press green "circulation", now it turns red. > press red "Quick purge", now it turns green.
	4. After you have low Oxigen, turn off the "Quick purge"
	5. Turn on the "circulation". Always keep it in circulation mode except for purging and changing the gas tank.
8. Transferring stuff from the transfer chamber to the glovebox
	1. Rotate the black valve under the chamber so that it points up direction to stop the vacuum pump.
	2. Open the inside cover of the transfer chamber.
	3. Transfer the stuff
	4. Close the cover
	5. Draw the vacuum on the transfer chamber.
9. After weighting, put your specimens in a container
10. Transfer it to the transfer chamber using the same procedure as when we transfer the staff to the glove box.
11. Transfer it from the transfer chamber to the outside using the same procedure as when we put the stuff inside the transfer chamber. 
12. Set the pressure to the original one
	1. Press the box in the middle
	2. Set the "lower working limit" to 4
	3. Press "BACK". Don't forget to press this! It's like entering.
	4. Press "End"
13. Record the last condition in the form


### Notes
- If the gas falls below 30, change the gas. 
- If you use it on Friday, Saturday, and below 50, also change the gas. It will decrease slowly during idle.
