# Defect ion in perovskite
A brief introduction to defect ion in perovskite.

Perovskite is an $ABX_3$ compound.

B is a divalent cation.
X is an anion.

## A
A is a monovalent cation.
A can be organic such as Methylammonium ($MA^+$ , $CH_3NH_3$ ), Formamidinium ($FA^+$ , $HC(NH_2))_2$)
or inorganic such as $Cs^+$ 

## B 
B is a divalent cation.
Commonly Pb and Sn.

## X 
X is an anion.
Halide such as I or Br. 

## Defects
This metal halides perovskite can have diverse intrinsic point defects such as:
- ==Vancancies== on each position
- ==Antisites==, where atoms/Ion interchanged
- ==Interstitials==, atoms/ions located on nonlattice positions. 

Many defect appear paired, for example: $X^-$ moves to an interstitial position and leaves a vacancy behind, and form ==Frenkel defect==.
Whereas non paired defect so-called ==Schottky defect== (e. g. An $X^-$ vacancy) are less likely.
