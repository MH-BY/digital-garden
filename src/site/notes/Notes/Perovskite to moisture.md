# Perovskite to moisture

The perovskite structure tent to hydrolyse, undergoing irreversible degradation and decomposing back into precursors.

For example:
highly hygroscopic $CH_3NH_3X$ and $CH(NH_2)_2X$ salts and $PbX_2$ with X= halide. 

the process can be accelerated by heat, electric field, and ultraviolet exposure.

## How to mitigate
- adding cross-linking additives or by compositional engineering:
	- adding combination of $Pb(CH_3CO_2)_2$ $3H_2O$ and $PbCl_2$ in the precursors
	- using cation cascade: Cs and Rb cations --> also reduce material photo-instability and/or optimize the film morphology
- Using a buffer layer between HTM and the perovskite
- Using moisture-blocking HTM such as $Ni0_x$
