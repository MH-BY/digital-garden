# Wealth is a process, not an event

Most people focus on the event. Oh, A just won the lottery. B just got venture capital. etc.
But wealth, the sustainable one is truly a process, not just an event.
Like a chef preparing the perfect dish. It is a well engineered process of executions: a little of this, a little of that, several minutes of low heat, the timing for seasoning, etc. Wealth creation is almost the same. It is a process of fabrication of many disassociated ingredients into an assembled whole that has value and is worth millions.

If you try to skip the process, you'll never experience events.
Bombard the world with your process, and you will meet the events.
