2. Customize
3. Start publish

## My homework
- [ ] Need to know how can we monitor traffic
	- [Some one connect analytics using convertkit](https://joschuasgarden.com/50+Slipbox/How+to+view+basic+analytics+for+Obsidian+Publish
	- Check notes: [[Notes/ConvertKit\|ConvertKit]]
- [ ] Need to know how to do SEO
- [ ] [Discount 40% for students](https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+%26+Payment/Education+and+non-profit+discount) it means sync=0.6x8$, publish=0.6x16=9.6 USD
