## My homework
- [ ] Need to know how can we monitor traffic
	- [Some one connect analytics using convertkit](https://joschuasgarden.com/50+Slipbox/How+to+view+basic+analytics+for+Obsidian+Publish
	- Check notes: [[Notes/ConvertKit\|ConvertKit]]
- [ ] Need to know how to do SEO
- [ ] [Discount 40% for students](https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+%26+Payment/Education+and+non-profit+discount) it means sync=0.6x8$, publish=0.6x16=9.6 USD

# No! I changed my mind
- Instead, I use an obsidian plugin called [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). The documentation is [here](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/). It's awesome and free.....
   The basic idea is that you push your notes into GitHub, and use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) to make a static website. 
   Here is my website www.emhabayu.com
