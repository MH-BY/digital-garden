# Wealth is process, not an event

Most people focuses on event. Oh, A just won in lottery. B just got venture capital. etc.
But a wealth, the sustainable one is truly a process, not just an event.
Like a chef preparing the perfect dish. It is a well engineered process of executions: a little of this, a little of that, several minutes of low heat, timing for seasoning, etc. Wealth creation is almost the same. It is a process of fabrication of many disassociated ingredient in to an assembled whole that has value and is worth millions.

If you try to skip process, you'll never experience events.
Bombard the world with your process, you will met the events.
