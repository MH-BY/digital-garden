# My Second Brain

[[Notes/Hi I am Emha\|Hi I am Emha]]. Welcome to my second brain!
These are interconnected notes of mine. Some of them are messy, random, and unpolished. Yes, because they were initially intended for me personally on my personal knowledge management tools Obsidian. I want to make it works like how the brain works. The knowledge grows overtime. The note as a neuron are interconnected, one may find a way to connect with a distance topic to form serendipity. It might be updated/expanded as my perception toward the world grows.
