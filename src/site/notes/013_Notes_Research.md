## Pre-investigation (self note)
1. Read literature to find:
| Structure | Precursors | exp. condition | Contacts | Energies | Endurance | Retention time | on-off ratio |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------ |
|           |            |                |          |          |           |                |              |

2. Look for in-situ measurement possible (opto + electronic)
