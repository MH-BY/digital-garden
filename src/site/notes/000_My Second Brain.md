# My Second Brain

[[Notes/Hi my name is Emha\|Hi my name is Emha]]. Welcome to my second brain!
These are interconnected notes of mine. Some of them are messy, random, and unpolished. Yes, because they were initially intended for me personally on my personal knowledge management tool Obsidian. I want to make it works like how the brain works. The knowledge grows over time. The notes as neurons are interconnected, one may find a way to connect with a distant topic to form serendipity. It might be updated/expanded as my perception of the world grows. 

I decided to share some of my notes. Hopefully, some resonate with yours, connect us, and give serendipity to your ideas as well as mine. Forgive me if you encounter dead links. It means that I forgot to sync it, or I just intentionally don't want to share it. 

How to surf? It is up to you.
You can search for topics you like, click some random notes, or explore the connected notes on the graph view. 
Below are topics that may be a good door to enter to My Second Brain.

## Notes related to study
You can find my project home page for anything related to study in  [[003_PJ_home_Study\|003_PJ_home_Study]] .
It consists of something like [[Notes/Course requirements\|Course requirements]] , in case you are curious about what requirements or courses need to be taken by PhD student at NTU. 
Or you can find my micro notes about my research in [[013_Notes_Research\|013_Notes_Research]]. Probably quite tedious and interesting to dig there. You will find my notes related to references like bunch of [[Notes/Paper Annotations\|Paper Annotations]], knowledge related to perovskite and [[Notes/Memristor\|Memristor]],  etc.

## Notes related to Books I read
Yes, once upon a time I was so pumped to make a proper review of books in [[004_PJ_home_BookReview\|004_PJ_home_BookReview]]. 
I think one that I properly reviewed was [[Books/Books review/The Millionaire Fastlane (review)\|The Millionaire Fastlane (review)]]. You will find atomic insights like [[Notes/Wealth is process, not an event\|Wealth is process, not an event]], [[Notes/Be a producer not consumer\|Be a producer not consumer]], [[Notes/Four ingredients to win\|Four ingredients to win]], etc. Dive in!
Or may be [[Books/Books review/Atomic Habits (review)\|Atomic Habits (review)]] by James Clear.
The rest? I am too lazy to make a proper review. But I have the rough annotations btw:
-  [[Books/Highlights/2019-The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book-Andriy Burkov\|2019-The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book-Andriy Burkov]]
- [[Books/Highlights/Al-Ghazzali-The Alchemy of Happiness\|Al-Ghazzali-The Alchemy of Happiness]]
- [[Books/Highlights/Ball-The Elements\|Ball-The Elements]]
- [[Books/Highlights/Kahneman-Thinking, Fast and Slow\|Kahneman-Thinking, Fast and Slow]]
Etc.
Some of them are in progress

## Some other notes
Or, some random notes like:
- Notes related to productivity here:  [[015_Notes_Productivity\|015_Notes_Productivity]]
- Want to be good at having notes [[Notes/Introduction to Zettelkasten\|Introduction to Zettelkasten]]
- Notes related to obsidian:  [[Notes/Why I choose Obsidian\|Why I choose Obsidian]] which I have the [Youtube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLIWRcY_qmA&t=49s&ab_channel=EmhaBayu) (bahasa Indonesia tho.), [[Notes/How to make book review in Obsidian\|How to make book review in Obsidian]], [[Notes/Zotero X Obsidian workflow\|Zotero X Obsidian workflow]]



These notes are growing. In case you are wondering how they grow, consider to subscribe to my [[Notes/Newsletter\|Newsletter]]. I will compile the ideas from my messy second brain and make an edible article for you bi-weekly. Don't worry, I will not spam you.
