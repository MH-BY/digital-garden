# Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones

## The book in three points
- "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."  
- The best way of building a habit is making it part of your identity.  
- Make it easy to start: Habits are the entry point - not the goal. "Read 30 books" ⇒ "Read before bed every night" ⇒ "Read one page". Reduce a habit into a 2-minute first step.  
- Stick to the plan: "Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way." Don't be a "fair weather runner" if you want to run a lot.  
- Make it hard to do the things you want to avoid.

## Impressions
There are books talk about habit such as [[The power of habit\|The power of habit]] by Charles Duhigg.
I found more applicable strategy in this book such as: 
- Reduce a habit into a 2-minutes first step.
- Just put on your shoes in the morning. --> then your habit of running will follows.

## How the book changed me
It helps me built habit from the small one, added with yet another small one, and eventually become a good sequence of good habits.
As for example in my case:
- Put my kindle near my bed-->Reading book before sleep 
- After Subuh prayer --> read Quran --> exercise --> take a bath.

## My top 3 quotes
1.  “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” 
2. “Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.”
3. “The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.”

## Summary and notes
Atomic Habits by James Clear is a book about forming better habits and achieving success. The book provides an easy-to-follow framework for understanding the nature of habits and how to make them work for you rather than against you. It emphasizes small, incremental changes that compound over time to create meaningful results. Clear outlines four laws of behavior change: Make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. He also provides practical tips for creating new habits and breaking old ones, as well as strategies for overcoming obstacles and remaining motivated. Atomic Habits is an essential read for anyone looking to form better habits and achieve their goals.
