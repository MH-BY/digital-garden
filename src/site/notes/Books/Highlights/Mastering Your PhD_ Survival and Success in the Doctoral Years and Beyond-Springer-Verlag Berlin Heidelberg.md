the type of group you work in can determine, to a large extent, the way you work, as well as the type and frequency of interaction you have with your advisor. Your success will be infuenced not only by having a good advisor (or a professor with a famous name), but also by your relationships with the other PhD students and Post-docs in the lab. So try to evaluate the dynamics of the group you’re in and identify your allies. Putting some effort into these relationships — location: []()

As you work your way through the settling in process, take some time (a few days if necessary) to write down your shortand long-term goals and objectives — location: []()
{ #ref-55431}


---
One of the best ways to identify your goals is to start by writing down an action plan. This type of activity usually involves the following steps: 1. Clarify your goals and objectives. First look at the big picture and then break things down into shorter time segments — location: []()
{ #ref-54135}


---
What do you want to have accomplished by the end of the frst six months of graduate study? The frst year? Sketch these goals out broadly, as they are likely to change over time. Now, write down your objectives for the next three months, and then fne tune these for over the next month. Now that you’ve written your goals down, ask yourself two things: are my goals measurable? How will I know when I’ve achieved my goal — location: []()
{ #ref-52071}


---
2. Write down a list of actions. Now it’s time to think about all the things you need to do to achieve your goals. What limitations and constraints do you have in terms of time, know-how, equipment, material, etc? Write down as many actions as you can that will help you achieve your goals. 3. Prioritize. Take a good look at your list. Prioritize the actionable points so that you do frst what is most effcient and what will most likely assist you in achieving your goals. 4. Organize your actions into a plan. Actions that are set into a time framework make up a plan. Make sure your plan is workable. Can you do the actions you have set up for yourself in the time frame you’ve allotted? Make sure you’ve ordered your actions into a logical sequence. 5. Monitor and measure your progress. On a regular basis you will have to monitor your plan and make adjustments if necessary. It’s important to remain fexible and re-state your goals from time to time as necessary and as you gain more experience with your project (for more details on how to do this, see Chap. 6: Monthly Progress Monitor — location: []()

Effective Time Management Once you’ve identifed your short-term and long-term objectives, managing your time effectively will be key to keeping to your plan and attaining the goals you’ve identifed. — location: []()

One useful tool in effective time management is to keep a record of your activities — location: []()

Record your daily activities like this every day for a week. Every time you change activities, whether its reading e-mail, working in the lab, making coffee, sleeping, eating lunch, reading in the library, or attending meetings, note down when you do this and how you feel — location: []()
{ #ref-6620}


---
Learning from the Record Once you have noted the way you use your time every day for a week, go back and analyse what you have recorded — location: []()
{ #ref-36636}


---
Another useful tool for helping you get everything done is to draw up a to-do list. This can be done daily or weekly, whatever works best for you. A to-do list is a list of all the tasks that you need to carry out to reach the goal you have set for yourself. Once you’ve written your list, you can prioritize these tasks into order of importance — location: []()
{ #ref-62573}


---
Preparing a To-Do List The solution to feeling overwhelmed is simple: Write down the tasks you need to do, and if they are large, break them down into their component elements. If these still seem too large too handle, break them down again. Do this until you have listed everything that you have to do. Once you have done this, run through your list and allocate priorities — location: []()

The 80/20 Rule Attributed to the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, the original concept of the 80/20 rule states that the relationship between input and output is rarely, if ever, proportional. When applied to your work, it means that only 20% of your efforts produce 80% of the results. Learning to identify the 20% that produces the majority of your results is the key to making the most effective use of your time — location: []()
{ #ref-30330}


---
1. Take a look at the people around you. Twenty percent of your colleagues probably give you 80% of the support you need. They are your true advocates. Take the time to learn from their example and to cultivate supportive relationships with them. 2. Take a close look at your work. Ask yourself, Which 20% of my work should I be focusing on — location: []()
{ #ref-53633}


---
You’re focusing on the 80% if the following statements are true: • You’re working on tasks other people want you to do, but you yourself have little or no stake in them. • You’re frequently working on tasks considered ‘urgent.’ • You’re spending time on tasks you are not particularly good at. • Completing some activities is taking much more time than you expected. • You fnd yourself complaining all the time about how little you seem to be accomplishing • compared to the effort you put in. — location: []()
{ #ref-15824}


---
You’re focusing on the effective 20%, however, if: • You’re engaged in activities that advance your overall goals in the lab. • You’re working on tasks that you may not like, but you’re doing them knowing they relate to the bigger picture. • You’re asking for help with tasks you are not good at doing yourself. • You feel a sense of accomplishment. — location: []()

Saving an old master painting: Yousef establishes a set of goals Not one to waste any time, Yousef decides to start off on the right foot by establishing some goals and objectives for himself during the frst week in the lab. Some of these goals are non-research related, such as familiarizing himself with the department and the library and setting up his work space. Even though he’s anxious to do his frst experiment in the lab, he takes the time to write down some goals for his research. First, he needs to do some background reading as he knows very little about the chemistry and physical properties of paint pigments. Even though he is a physics student, he also wants to read up a bit on art history, so he can put the project into context and make it easier to talk to Peter with whom he is collaborating. He sketches out in his notebook his goals for the frst month, and then for the three month, and six month mark, and then creates a realistic action plan for himself in the given time frame. Since he will be using a relatively new technique for studying paint samples (secondary ion mass spectrometry, or SIMS), Yousef has made one of his goals to do a thorough literature search on this technique. He also maps out an initial set of experiments, and highlights any possible pitfalls. Yousef is pleased that he now has a plan to work with and goes out for a coffee. In the hallway he runs into his supervisor and Yousef realizes that he has not discussed his plans with him at all. So he tells his supervisor about his ideas and asks for a brief meeting to be sure that his plans are in line with his supervisor’s own ideas and vision. After some minor modifcations they agree on the plan and Yousef communicates to his teammates the things he wants to work on in the coming months — location: []()

Consider a classic mistake made by the philosopher, Aristotle, who many people consider to be the father of the scientifc method. He emphatically stated that women have fewer teeth than men (probably to support his argument that men were superior). He never actually tried to prove this fact; he just used this misconception as a way to prove what everybody in ancient Greece accepted at face value anyway (that men are superior to women!). Now we all know that adult men and women have the exact same number of teeth – so don’t fall into the same trap as Aristotle.

Without the scientifc method, we might still believe in the idea of spontaneous generation (that fies, for example, are ‘born’ out of rotten meat), a theory that was disproved by Françesco Redi and Louis Pasteur in an ingenious experiment using the principles of the scientifc method. As a result of his experiments Pasteur concluded that there is no life force in air, and organisms do not arise by spontaneous generation [from rotten meat] in this manner. ‘Life is a germ, and a germ is Life — location: []()

Part of your training in learning how to ‘think like a scientist’ involves dealing with the inevitable setbacks that will occur, and learning to cultivate the virtue of patience.

You and your mentor should decide how to move forward and how much interaction you will have. Perhaps you’ll meet over lunch once a month or touch base regularly via e-mail, or your mentor will be available whenever you have a specifc issue.

you might formalize these conclusions by sending your supervisor an e-mail in which you list the agreed upon actions. “We should talk more often” is not a truly actionable conclusion. “Let’s sit together every Friday for half an hour after lunch” is a much better actionable result of your evaluation (make a SMART plan as discussed in Chap. 3) — location: []()

Your outline should consist of several pages that contain chapter headings, sub-headings, fgure and table titles and some keywords and essential comments. Once you have created a comprehensive outline, you will have a framework or scaffold from which to work. In addition, an outline is a great tool for preventing writer’s block, as you only need to fll in one section at a time of your outline, rather than face the enormous task of writing a document that will be well in excess of a hundred pages.

A PhD Thesis Is: • A formal document, quite substantial in length, that presents original data in support of a particular thesis or supposition. • A comprehensive body of data that supports a particular hypothesis and is well-supported with appropriate evidence. The scientifc method requires you to state a hypothesis and then gather data to support or negate your hypothesis. Before you can write a thesis defending a particular hypothesis or hypotheses, you must gather suffcient evidence to support it. • A thorough analysis and interpretation of the data you have collected. This analysis forms the heart of your thesis. • A document in which every statement is supported by citing the scientifc literature or your own (original) work. • A document in which every statement must be correct and defensible in a logical and scientifc sense. There is no room in your thesis for suppositions and conclusions that you pull out of thin air — location: []()

{ #ref-833}


---
. Don’t reinvent the wheel: transform your published articles into thesis chapters. 5. Create a time frame (and deadline) for yourself and stick to it. 6. Find a quiet place to write where you will be free from distractions (the lab is usually not a good place to write a thesis – work from home or in a quiet place like the library). 7. Assign yourself a number of pages to write each day and stop when you are done. This will prevent you from spending 24 hours a day at the computer, agonizing over your progress. When you’ve written your assigned 4–5 pages, then you’re fnished for the day. Turn off the computer and do something else. 8. Take plenty of breaks, and be sure to spend time with friends and family. Just don’t bore them, however, by constantly talking about your thesis and complaining about how hard it is to write. 9. Get some exercise, eat well, and take care of your health. 10. Don’t work in utter solitude. This is not the time to turn into a hermit. If other PhD students in your lab or department are writing their theses at the same time, consider creating an informal support group where you can share the stresses of writing a thesis and have people at hand who are willing to read or proof read certain sections or even the entire manuscript — location: []()

For better or worse, the science-related corporate world values research differently than that of academia. Industry typically views research as an essential part of its business strategy. For scientists, this means less freedom and, very likely, greater short-term impact. This difference in values generally results in different ways of working, and a different set of required skills. — location: []()

Corporate research focuses on the company’s long-term product pipeline: the products it hopes to launch over the next 5, 10 or 15 years. Research activities may not be related to a product the company is already selling or about to launch (this isn’t true for pharma companies); rather, the company may be exploring new products or even whole new technologies that may or may not become marketed products, eventually — location: []()

Finally it takes a lot of engineering to fgure out how to produce a reliable product, which has the desired functionality and quality, at reasonable cost.

The early stages of the research part of R&D can be still quite academic; they are, however, largely motivated by the company’s strategy and product roadmap.

Some scientists fnd such constraints disagreeable, considering them to be restrictions on their curiosity-driven work, or a compromise of science for commercial ends. Yet there is an undeniable thrill in knowing that you’re working on something that will be actually used, whether it’s to make the world a profoundly better place or merely to give pleasure to consumers.

is quite clear: the 1000+ people employed by the same global company work together towards the same ends. Communication is fast and open within the company, while interactions with the outside world are restricted: the process of publishing is carefully timed and controlled in industry so as not to put the company’s IP at risk, or to disclose too much of its strategy. In contrast, the academic world is not so starkly divided; today’s competitor may well be tomorrow’s collaborator, and vice versa. Alliances are always shifting — location: []()

There are many issues to consider before starting on a career path in the nonproft sector, including your personal and professional career goals. Here are a few of the advantages: • A wide range of excellent and compatible colleagues. Nonprofts often have their pick of the brightest and most dedicated candidates, many of whom share your values. Staff members typically have a passion for their work and are committed to effecting social change. The result in many cases is an atmosphere of passion, teamwork, and collaboration. • Excellent opportunities for professional growth. Due to the lower staff-to-project ratio in many smaller organizations – and often a fatter organizational structure – you may be assigned several projects and a wide range of tasks, offering you a better-than-average opportunity to strengthen your skill set. • Flexibility. Compared with a corporate enterprise, for example, nonprofts may offer more fexibility in setting and achieving goals, establishing benchmarks, and setting strategies for meeting the organization’s mission — location: []()
{ #ref-45625}


---
Like any sector, nonprofts have some potential downsides: • Lower salary. Most but not all nonprofts pay salaries lower than those in industry. This is especially true of advocacy organizations. But there’s a wide range across the nonproft sector, so don’t let this particular issue discourage you — location: []()
{ #ref-13864}


---
Higher employee turnover. There are many reasons for employee turnover in the nonproft sector; burnout is high on the list, particularly if the organization is understaffed and you are required to multitask. Staff members may leave for better paying jobs, to switch sectors, or to return to school. Often, the smaller nonprofts lack professional-development tools aimed at retaining employees. • Limited opportunities for career advancement. At smaller nonprofts, like most small organizations, upper management is very stable, so you might have to switch to another organization to advance in your career. • Structural differences. If you thrive on hierarchy, discernable targets, and clear deliverables, small and medium-sized nonprofts might not be for you. Organizational clarity may be lacking, as these smaller nonprofts strive to fulfll their missions with limited staffng and resources. In larger and better funded organizations, these differences from industry tend to be less pronounced. • Fundraising. Depending on the type of nonproft, much time will be spent raising funds and writing grants — location: []()

Perhaps the two most important, and the ones that run through all the chapters like a common thread, are proper planning and good communication — location: []()

To repeat a statement that we included in the introduction: former PhD students claim that the communication, planning, and problem solving skills they acquired during their PhD research are as useful to them, if not more, as the actual content that went into their thesis. — location: []()

Planning Is Essential Scientists tend to be skeptical by nature. It goes with the territory. So many of them claim that you simply cannot plan science. Research, after all, has a life and rhythm of its own. So some feel that trying to plan your time in the lab is a wasted effort. Indeed, you can not plan the outcome of your scientifc efforts. But we still believe in the importance of proper planning (and this includes time management) and that good planning will maximize your chances of getting the most out of your time in the lab — location: []()

Therefore, we have repeatedly suggested that you identify the potential hurdles you might have to leap over, and pitfalls that you need to avoid. For instance, during your monthly progress review. Once you have identifed potential problems you can consider alternative approaches for obtaining the result you want — location: []()

Very few people will start marching to the tune of your drum, even if you think that’s the best way to proceed. You have limited power to change the behaviour of others, so in order to ensure that they deliver on their promises, you will have to plan carefully and be realistic about lead times for all the things (and the list is long) that are not under your control — location: []()

Share your good news with others (celebrate your success), and ask for help and advice if you are making less progress than you expected. Be able to admit it if you don’t know the answer to something. Ask questions. Listen to the answers. If you have an open attitude and make clear what you expect from others and what they can expect from you, your years as a graduate student will be more productive, not to mention much more pleasant. — location: []()

A key aspect of good communication is active listening, a skill that is also of great value during job interviews and meetings. As you make steady progress in your project, you might forget to communicate frequently. When work needs to be done, it may seem to you that talking, and especially listening, is a waste of time. — location: []()

Think how important something as trivial as a proper subject line is when you write an e-mail. Words carry a great deal of impact. A well thought out subject heading will have a much better chance of being acted upon by the receiver. So it is with talking and listening to the members of your team. — location: []()

Enjoy and celebrate your successes – such as the occasion when you’re the frst person to obtain novel data about a particular topic and are able to draw conclusions from it. Doing science in a research institute is a job, certainly, but it’s a special one. Some even say that it’s a calling. You’re surrounded by young, hard-working and ambitious people. So don’t forget that there are also many opportunities to have fun with your fellow students. You’re all in this together, so don’t be afraid to inject levity and humour into the day-to-day seriousness of your work — location: []()
