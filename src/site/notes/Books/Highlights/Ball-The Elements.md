1624 the French chemist Étienne de Clave was arrested for heresy. De Clave’s inadmissible ideas did not concern the interpretation of holy scripture. Nor were they of a political nature. They did not even challenge the place of man in the universe, as Galileo was doing so boldly. — location: [204]()

He believed that all substances were composed of two elements – water and earth – and ‘mixts’ of these two with three other fundamental substances or ‘principles’: mercury, sulphur, and salt. It was not a new idea: the great French pharmacist Jean Béguin, who published Tyrocinium chymicum (The Chemical Beginner), one of the first chemistry textbooks, in 1610, maintained until his death a decade later that all matter had essentially those same five basic ingredients. — location: [206]()

Phosphorus is indispensable, not only in bone but in the DNA molecules that orchestrate life in all its forms. Sulphur is an important component of proteins, helping to hold them in their complex shapes. But beyond these key players is a host of others that life cannot do without.

Thales of Miletus (c.620–c.555 BC), one of the first known enquirers into the constitution of the physical world, posited only one fundamental substance: water. There is ample justification for this view in myth; the Hebrew god was not the only deity to bring forth the world from a primal ocean. — location: [275]()
{ #ref-46821}

Anaximander (c.611–547 BC), Thales’ successor, avoided the issue with his contention that things are ultimately made of apeiron, the ‘indefinite’ and unknowable first substance. Anaximenes (d. c.500 BC) decided that air, not water, was primary. For Heraclitus (d. 460 BC), fire was the stuff of creation. — location: [279]()

but there is also a practical reason to invoke fundamental elements: things change. Water freezes or boils away. Wood burns, transforming a heavy log to insubstantial ashes. Metals melt; food is ingested and most of it is somehow spirited away inside the stomach. — location: [287]()
{ #ref-24865}


---
To this end, Anaximander believed that change came about through the agency of contending opposite qualities: hot and cold, and dry and moist. When Empedocles (c.490–c.430 BC) postulated the four elements that gained ascendancy in Western natural philosophy, he too argued that their transformations involved conflict. — location: [292]()
{ #ref-53823}


---
Empedocles does not exactly fit the mould of a sober and dignified Greek philosopher. Legend paints him as a magician and miracle worker who could bring the dead back to life. Reputedly he died by leaping into the volcanic maw of Mount Etna, convinced he was an immortal god. — location: [295]()
{ #ref-26335}


---
Small wonder, perhaps, that his earth, air, fire, and water were wrought into different blends – the materials of the natural world – through the agency of the colourful principles Love and Strife. Love causes mixing; Strife, separation. Their conflict is an eternal waxing and waning: at one time, Love dominates and things mix, but then Strife arises to pull them apart. This applies, said Empedocles, not just to the elements but to the lives of people and cultures. — location: [296]()
{ #ref-56704}


---
Aristotle shared Anaximander’s view that the qualities heat, cold, wetness, and dryness are the keys to transformation, and also to our experience of the elements. It is because water is wet and cold that we can experience it. Each of the elements, in Aristotle’s ontology, is awarded two of these qualities, so that one of them can be converted to another by inverting one of the qualities. Wet, cold water becomes dry, cold earth by turning wetness to dryness (Fig. 1 — location: [304]()

Leucippus of Miletus (fifth century BC) is generally credited with introducing the concept of atoms, but we know little more about him than that. He maintained that these tiny particles are all made of the same primal substance, but have different shapes in different materials. His disciple Democritus (c.460–370 BC) called these particles atomos, meaning uncuttable or indivisible. — location: [311]()
{ #ref-48045}


---
Democritus reconciled this fledgling atomic theory with the classical elements by positing that the atoms of each element have shapes that account for their properties. — location: [314]()

---
Fire atoms are immiscible with others, but the atoms of the other three elements get entangled to form dense, tangible matter. — location: [315]()
{ #ref-54637}


---
Democritus supposed that atoms move about in a void. Other philosophers ridiculed this idea of ‘nothingness’, maintaining that the elements must fill all of space. Anaxagoras (c.500–428 BC), who taught both Pericles and Euripides in Athens, claimed that there was no limit to the smallness of particles, so that matter was infinitely divisible. This meant that tiny grains would fill up all the nooks between larger grains, like sand between stones. Aristotle asserted – and who can blame him? – that air would fill any void between atoms. (This becomes a problem only if you consider that air is itself made of atoms.) — location: [320]()
{ #ref-46923}


---
Plato had it all figured out neatly. He was not an atomist in the mould of Democritus, but he did conceive of atom-like fundamental particles of the four Empedoclean elements. — location: [325]()
{ #ref-64779}


---
His geometrical inclinations led him to propose that these particles had regular, mathematical shapes: the polyhedra called regular Platonic solids. Earth was a cube, air an octahedron, fire a tetrahedron and water an icosahedron. — location: [326]()
{ #ref-5658}


---
The flat faces of each of these shapes can be made from two kinds of triangle. These triangles are, according to Plato, the true ‘fundamental particles’ of nature, and they pervade all space. The elements are converted by rearranging the triangles into new geometric forms. — location: [327]()
{ #ref-24616}


---
There is a fifth Platonic regular solid too: the dodecahedron, which has pentagonal (five-sided) faces. This polyhedron cannot be made from the triangles of the other four, which is why Plato assigned it to the heavens. There is thus a fifth classical element, which Aristotle called the aether. But it is inaccessible to earthly beings, and so plays no part in the constitution of mundane matter. — location: [330]()
{ #ref-20444}


---
This fourness of fundamental principles reaches further, embracing the four points of the compass (Chinese tradition acknowledges five elements, and five ‘directions’) and the four ‘humours’ of classical medicine. According to the Greek physician Galen (AD c.130–201), our health depends on the balance of these four essences: red blood, white phlegm, and black and yellow bile. — location: [344]()

What this really means is that the classical elements are familiar representatives of the different physical states that matter can adopt. Earth represents not just soil or rock, but all solids. Water is the archetype of all liquids; air, of all gases and vapours. Fire is a strange one, for it is indeed a unique and striking phenomenon. Fire is actually a dancing plasma of molecules and molecular fragments, excited into a glowing state by heat. It is not a substance as such, but a variable combination of substances in a particular and unusual state caused by a chemical reaction. In experiential terms, fire is a perfect — location: [363]()

{ #ref-38886}


---
This atomistic poem was condemned by religious zealots in the Middle Ages, and barely escaped complete destruction. But it surfaced in the seventeenth century as a major influence on the French scientist Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655), whose vision of a mechanical world of atoms in motion represented one of the many emerging challenges to the Aristotelian orthodoxy. — location: [379]()

It may seem strange from today’s perspective that several of the substances recognized today as elements – the metals gold, silver, iron, copper, lead, tin, and mercury – were not classed as such in antiquity, even though they could be prepared in an impressively pure state. — location: [385]()

There is evidence of the mining and use of gold in the region of Armenia and Anatolia from before 5000 BC; copper use is similarly ancient in Asia. Copper mostly occurs not as the metal, however, but as a mineral ore: a chemical compound of copper and other elements, such as copper carbonate (the minerals malachite and azurite). These copper ores were used as pigments and colouring agents for glazes, — location: [394]()

Lead was smelted from one of its ores (galena) since around 3500 BC, but was not common until 1,000 years later. Tin seems to originate in Persia around 1800–1600 BC, and iron in Anatolia around 1400 BC. — location: [399]()

This sequence of discovery of the metals reflects the degree of difficulty in separating the pure metal from its ore: iron clings tightly to oxygen in the common mineral ore haematite (ochre), and intense heat and charcoal are needed to prise them apart. — location: [401]()

longer haphazard; they had a theoretical underpinning in the sulphur-mercury theory of the Arabic alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan. Jabir is more the name of a school of thought than of a person. Many more writings are attributed to him than he could possibly have written, and there is some doubt about whether he existed at all. The Jabirian tradition works curious things with the Aristotelian elements. It accepts them implicitly but then, so far as metals are concerned, adds another layer between these fundamental substances and reality. — location: [412]()
{ #ref-22785}


---
According to Jabir, the ‘fundamental qualities’ of metals are the Aristotelian hot, cold, dry, and moist. But the ‘immediate qualities’ are two ‘principles’: sulphur and mercury. All metals are deemed to be mixtures of sulphur and mercury. — location: [416]()

mixtures of this sulphur and mercury yield not gold but the Holy Grail of alchemy, the Philosopher’s Stone, the smallest quantity of which can transform base metals to gold. — location: [419]()

It marks the beginning of a tendency to pay lip service to Aristotle while getting on with more practical concerns about what things are made of. — location: [425]()

The next step away from the traditions of antiquity involved the addition of a third ‘principle’ to Jabir’s sulphur and mercury: salt. — location: [426]()
{ #ref-3577}

The three-principle theory is generally attributed to the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus (1493–1541), although it is probably older. Paracelsus asserted that sulphur, salt, and mercury ‘form everything that lies in the four elements’. — location: [428]()
{ #ref-40774}


---
By the end of the seventeenth century, things had moved on again. There was no longer any perceived obligation to square one’s views with Aristotle, and the ‘principles’ were widely regarded as elements in their own right. Jean Béguin listed a popular scheme of five elements: mercury, sulphur, salt, phlegm, and earth. — location: [431]()

In their endless quest for the Philosopher’s Stone, alchemists burnt, distilled, melted, and condensed all manner of substances and stumbled across many technologically important new compounds, such as phosphorus and nitric acid. But in the 1600s there appeared a transitional group of natural philosophers whose primary objective was no longer to conduct the Great Work of alchemical transformation but to study and understand matter at a more mundane level. — location: [443]()
{ #ref-44517}


---
These ‘chymists’ were neither alchemists nor chemists; or, rather, they were a bit of both. One of them was Robert Boyle (1627–91). — location: [446]()

Traditionally portrayed as a broadside against alchemy in general, Boyle’s classic book The Sceptical Chymist (1661) in fact aims to distinguish the learned and respectable alchemical ‘adepts’ (such as Boyle himself) from the ‘vulgar laborants’ who sought after gold by means of blind recipe following. — location: [451]()

In other words, elements are to be found not by theorizing but by experiment: ‘I must proceed to tell you that though the assertors of the four elements value reason so highly . . . no man had ever yet made any sensible trial to discover their number.’ — location: [460]()
{ #ref-36306}


---
But he then proceeds to question whether anything of this sort truly exists – that is, whether there are elements at all. Certainly, Boyle holds back from offering any replacement for the elemental schemes he demolishes, although he shows some sympathy for the idea, advocated by the Flemish scientist Johann Baptista van Helmont, that everything is made of water. — location: [465]()
{ #ref-5994}


---
By the end of the seventeenth century, then, scientists were not really any closer to enumerating the elements than were the Greek philosophers. Yet a hundred years later the British chemist John Dalton (1766–1844) wrote a textbook that outlined a recognizably modern atomic theory and gave a list of elements that, while still very incomplete and sometimes plain wrong, is in content and in spirit a clear precursor to today’s tabulation of the hundred — location: [468]()

and more elements. Why had our understanding of the elements changed so fast? — location: [471]()
{ #ref-23146}


---
Boyle’s demand for experimental analysis as the arbiter of elemental status is a central component of this change. Another reason for the revolution was the relinquishment of old preconceptions about what elements should be like. — location: [472]()

classical scholars, an element had to correspond to (or at least be recognizable in) stuff that you found around you. — location: [473]()

Many of the substances today designated as elements are ones almost all of us will never see or hold; in antiquity, that would seem an absurd complication. — location: [474]()

short, there is nothing obvious about the elements. Until the twentieth century, scientists had no idea why there should be so many, nor indeed why there should not be thousands more.

Lavoisier (1743–94), like Condorcet, was misfortunate that the leading thinkers in France were likely, sooner or later, to become embroiled in politics.

Air is a more complex substance. The fraction that is ‘highly respirable air’, Lavoisier realized, is an element in itself: oxygen. — location: [518]()

---
For the ‘fluid’ that Lavoisier called mephitic air he proposed the name azot or azotic gas, a Greek term indicating that it is inimical to life. Lavoisier found that, when he isolated this component, it had the ‘quality of killing such animals as are forced to breathe it’. Reasonably enough, he concluded that it was noxious. In fact it is not poisonous but simply useless: separated from oxygen, it cannot sustain life. Lavoisier noted that this gas ‘is proved to form a part of the nitric acid, which gives a good reason to have called it nitrigen’. He preferred his azot, however, and so did the other French chemists – which is why nitrogen is known to this day as azote in France. — location: [520]()

Oxygen and nitrogen are elements, but most of these other gases are compounds formed by the reaction and joining together of two or more different elements. In oxygen gas, each atom of oxygen is bound to another atom of oxygen. In carbon monoxide, an oxygen atom is linked to an atom of carbon. — location: [535]()
{ #ref-52312}

In practice, Lavoisier found it necessary to use a chemical reaction to perform the separation: he allowed the oxygen to combine with other substances through combustion, leaving behind almost pure nitrogen. But modern techniques can perform the physical separation of these elements. — location: [546]()

for example, the ‘fixed air’ studied by Scottish chemist Joseph Black (1728–99). In the 1750s, Black found that a gas was produced when carbonate salts were heated or treated with acid. The air, he reasoned, was ‘fixed’ in the solids until liberated. Unlike common air, fixed air turned lime water (a solution of calcium hydroxide) cloudy. We now recognize that this is due to the formation of insoluble calcium carbonate – basically chalk. — location: [556]()

The legacy of Aristotle’s elements was still strong, and the pneumatick chemists preferred to regard each gas as ‘common air’ altered in some manner – for example, in states of greater or lesser impurity. Even Lavoisier found this a hard habit to shake off. — location: [570]()

Then a French pharmacist named Pierre Bayen pointed out to Lavoisier that ‘calx of mercury’, which we would now call mercuric oxide, can be converted to mercury simply by heating, without the need for ‘phlogiston-rich’ charcoal. Moreover, the gas released in this process was not Black’s fixed air, but something quite different. What was this gas? That started to become clear to Lavoisier when Joseph Priestley came to dinner. — location: [598]()

gas.   Seeing this report, Priestley realized that Lavoisier had not quite appreciated the ‘superior’ qualities of his ‘dephlogisticated air’ – it was not merely common air. He sent the Frenchman a sample of the gas to verify that this was so. As a result, Lavoisier presented a paper to the French Academy in April in which he identified the principle of combustion – Priestley’s gas – as an especially ‘pure air’. In keeping with his notorious arrogance, he made no mention of the contributions of Priestley and Bayen. — location: [622]()
{ #ref-39671}


---
Lavoisier may have been cavalier with his treatment of priority issues, but he went far beyond replicating the results of others. To Priestley, oxygen was always going to be regarded as a form of common air modified by the removal of phlogiston; Scheele too saw things very much in these terms. Lavoisier came to understand that this ‘pure air’ was actually a substance in its own right. In that case, air itself was not elemental but a mixture. It is Lavoisier who made oxygen an element. — location: [630]()

But Lavoisier was equally keen to make this new element the explanatory principle of acidity, itself still a profound mystery to chemists. In this he was less successful. Many non-metallic elements, such as sulphur, carbon, and phosphorus, combine with oxygen to produce gases that dissolve in water to make acids, and that is why Lavoisier named the new element as he did (in German oxygen is still known as Sauerstoff, ‘acid stuff’). But not all acids contain oxygen; and those that do, do not derive their acidity from it. — location: [634]()

single element can exhibit very different characteristics depending on what it is combined with. Chlorine is a corrosive, poisonous gas; combined with sodium in table salt, it is completely harmless. Carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen are the stuff of life, but carbon monoxide and cyanide (a combination of carbon and nitrogen) are deadly. This was a hard notion for chemists to accept. Lavoisier himself came under attack for claiming that water was composed of oxygen and hydrogen: for water puts out fires (it is ‘the most powerful antiphlogistic we possess’, according to one critic), whereas hydrogen is hideously flammable. — location: [639]()

burning, not expelled. Burning ends when the air is devoid of oxygen, not when it is saturated with phlogiston. Indeed, it is this mirror-image quality that made phlogiston seem to work so well. Science needed an element like this to explain combustion – but it simply looked at the problem the wrong way round. Phlogiston was oxygen’s shadow. — location: [645]()
{ #ref-62362}


---
Like many of his contemporaries, he regarded heat as a physical substance, rather like the ancient elemental fire. He called it caloric, and it sounded suspiciously like phlogiston in another guise. Caloric was what made substances gaseous; oxygen gas was replete with it. When oxygen reacted with metals to form calxes, caloric was released (heat was given out), and in consequence the oxygen became dense and heavy. — location: [654]()
{ #ref-42708}


---
These ideas are evident in an essay of Lavoisier’s from 1773, in which he identifies the three different physical states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Here he makes the crucial distinction between the physical and chemical nature of substances, which confused the ancients and led to their minimal elemental schemes. ‘The same body’, says Lavoisier, ‘can pass successively through each of these states, and in order to make this phenomenon occur it is necessary only to combine it with a greater or lesser quantity of the matter of fire.’ — location: [657]()

---
Despite these throwbacks, Lavoisier transformed the way chemists thought about elements. At the beginning of the eighteenth century it was common to imagine just five of them. In 1789 Lavoisier consolidated his oxygen theory by publishing a textbook, Traité élémentaire de chimie (An Elementary Treatise on Chemistry), that defined an element as any substance that could not be split into simpler components by chemical reactions. And he listed no fewer than thirty-three of them. — location: [666]()

fictitious (light, caloric). Several others were in fact compounds that chemists had not yet found how to decompose to their elements. But the message was clear: there is no ‘simple’ scheme of elements. There are lots of them out there, and it was up to chemists to find them. — location: [669]()

Now they see things very differently. The chemical composition of the air is not a precondition for life but the result of it. Around two billion years ago, primitive living organisms transformed the atmosphere from one largely devoid of oxygen to one with plenty of it. — location: [680]()

There is no known geological process that can maintain a high level of oxygen in our planet’s atmosphere. Eventually the gas will react with rocks and become locked away in the ground. Only biological processes can strip oxygen out of its combinations with other elements and return it to the skies. If all life on Earth were to end, the oxygen level would gradually dwindle to insignificance. For this reason, an oxygen-rich atmosphere is a beacon that proclaims the presence of life beneath it. — location: [682]()

After all, it takes only a single spark to persuade an entire forest to react with oxygen. The consequence in 1998–9 was a haze of smoke that covered Indonesia and altered the local climate.

Nature, however, makes do. If the air is full of poison, it will learn to live on poison. We breathe oxygen not because it is inherently good for us but because we have evolved ways of making it less bad for us. Enzymes mop up the deadly compounds formed as oxygen is used to burn sugar in the energy factories of our cells. These compounds include hydrogen peroxide, used as an industrial and a domestic bleach, and the even more destructive superoxide free radical. Such substances damage the delicate biomolecules of our cells, including DNA. Cells have molecular mechanisms that strive to repair the damage, but its inevitable accumulation is an important factor in the ageing process. — location: [703]()

On the other hand, the living world (the biosphere) has contrived to maintain the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere at more or less the perfect level for aerobic (oxygen-breathing) organisms like us. If there was less than 17 per cent oxygen in the air, we would be asphyxiated. If there was more than 25 per cent, all organic matter would be highly flammable: it would combust at the slightest provocation, and wildfires would be uncontrollable. A concentration of 35 per cent oxygen would have been enough to destroy most life on Earth in global fires in the past. — location: [710]()

hypothesis that the biological and geological systems of the Earth conspire to adjust the atmosphere and environment so that they are well suited to sustain life – the so-called Gaia hypothesis.

In addition, today’s proportion of atmospheric oxygen is large enough to support the formation of the ozone layer in the stratosphere, which protects life from the worst of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays.

include all plants and many species of bacteria. Oxygen is consumed by animals and other aerobic organisms. It is tempting to regard the steady level of oxygen as a balance between these sources and sinks in the biosphere. But there is more to it than that.

Because the biogeochemical cogs are always turning, the chemistry of the Earth is not at equilibrium. When a chemical process reaches equilibrium, all change ceases.

This disequilibrium of the Earth’s environment involves inorganic processes in sea and rock, but it is ultimately sustained by the biosphere – by life.

If life ceased, the planet would gradually settle towards a static equilibrium that would be very different from today’s environment. — location: [734]()

We can see this by looking at the atmospheres of our neighbouring planets. Venus and Mars are of a similar size to Earth, and they were formed from a roughly similar mixture of elements. But their skies now contain only tiny amounts of oxygen – less than 1 per cent – and only small quantities of nitrogen. Their atmospheres are both about 95 per cent carbon dioxide, even though that of Mars is very tenuous while that of Venus is very thick. — location: [737]()

On Venus this dense blanket of the greenhouse gas raises surface temperatures to around 750 °C; on Mars the thin sheet keeps things at a frigid –50 °C or so. In either case, the absence of oxygen and the proximity of the mixture of atmospheric gases to an equilibrium mixture proclaims from afar that there is no life to be found on these worlds. — location: [740]()
